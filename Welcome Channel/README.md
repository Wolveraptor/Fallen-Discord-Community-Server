        - Completing quests.
        - Farming specific items or resources.

        Informal Agreements: Players might make informal agreements about loot distribution, like agreeing to pass on certain items or trade loot after the session.

        LOOT DISTRIBUTION AND RULES:
        - LOOT SYSTEM OVERVIEW
        1. FAIR ROLLING: All loot is distributed through a rolling system to ensure fairness. The specifics of the rolling process are detailed below.
        2. ROLLING PROCESS:
        - Need Before Greed (NBG):
        - Need Roll: Roll if the item is a significant upgrade for your current main role (e.g., a DPS player rolling on a high-DPS weapon).
        - Greed Roll: Roll if you want the item for off-spec, selling, or Salvaging.
        - Greed rolls are made after all Need rolls have been resolved.
        3. ROLLING COMMANDS:
        - Need Roll: Type /roll 100 if you need the item for your main role.
        - Greed Roll: Type /roll 100 if you want the item for other purposes after need rolls are complete.
        4. DETERMINING THE WINNER:
        - The highest Need Roll wins the item.
        If no one rolls Need, the highest Greed Roll wins.


        PRIORITY RULES
        - PRIORITY RULES OVERVIEW:

        1. VETERAN PRIORITY: Players who have been actively participating in the group longer and contributing to the grind for the item have priority. 
        - (Veteran players will roll first): (THIS IS FOR GUILD GROUPS ONLY, NOT RAIDS OR PUGS, AND SHOULD BE COMMUNICATED IF ANYTHING SPECIFIC IS BEING FARMED/CAMPED)
        - (Newcomers Roll Last): Newcomers or those who joined the raid recently can roll only after the veteran players have rolled and had their chance at the item. (THIS IS FOR GUILD GROUPS ONLY, NOT RAIDS OR PUGS, AND SHOULD BE COMMUNICATED IF ANYTHING SPECIFIC IS BEING FARMED/CAMPED)
        2. MAINS OVER ALTS: Main characters (mains) have priority over alternate characters (alts). Alts can roll Need only if no mains roll Need for the item.

        LOOT DISTRIBUTION AND RULES (Continued)
        - HANDLING OF LOOT DISPUTES:
        1. PRIVATE RESOLUTION: Any disputes regarding loot distribution must be handled privately. If you have an issue, discuss it directly with the raid leader or designated officers.
        2. NO PUBLIC COMPLAINTS: Publicly airing grievances or complaints about loot decisions is not allowed. Maintain respect for the process and the raid group by keeping discussions private.


        - SPECIAL LOOT CONDITIONS
        1. ONE ITEM PER PLAYER: If a player wins an item, they may not roll Need again until all other players in the group have won an item during the session. This ensures fair distribution among all participants.
        2. ROLE/CLASS SPECIFIC ITEMS: Some items are more beneficial for specific roles (e.g., tanking gear for tanks). Such items should be rolled on Need only by players in that specific role unless no one in the role needs it.



        FINAL NOTES
        1. FAIRNESS AND RESPECT: These rules are designed to maintain fairness and respect within the raid group. All members are expected to adhere to these rules to ensure a smooth and enjoyable raiding experience for everyone.
        2. COMMUNICATION IS KEY: Clear communication and adherence to these rules will help prevent misunderstandings and ensure everyone has a fair chance at loot.

        - Sponsorship Period: (NO PREDETERMINED TIME FRAME) The sponsor and recruit should regularly play together during a designated sponsorship period. During this time, the sponsor assesses the recruit's suitability for full membership.
        - Sponsors should witness their Squire attend at least 1 guild event:  and determine if they were able to maintain comms discipline during the event, determine if they were able to follow instructions, and witness their level of participation during the event.
        3. PROMOTION: (To full membership AKA" KNIGHT)
        - Sponsors: To bring your squire to the rank of Knight and gain them full membership into the guild you must speak to a KING (Grizzle, Asharak, or Swatmedic) and be prepared to vouch for your squire's guild activity, attitude, willingness to help the guild and its members, and overall fitness to be a member of <FALLEN>. 
        - Timeframe: There is no set timeframe to promote a squire to full member, requests for promotion are at the discretion of the Sponsor, once a request is made the Sponsor will be heard and a decision will be made by the Kings.

        Welcome to the guild. Our community is built around dedicated players who thrive on structured progression, focused raiding, efficient dungeon runs, gear optimization, and strategic gameplay. We value preparation, teamwork, and consistency. While we are not strictly hardcore, we maintain a disciplined approach to improvement and performance. This balanced structure is our strength and the foundation of our continued success.

        As you step into our domain, be advised — this is an 18+ environment. While we aim to keep our focus on gameplay and avoid unnecessary distractions, we are all adults and approach conversations with that understanding. Expect unfiltered discussions, zero tolerance for drama, and respectful handling of disagreements. Everyone is entitled to their opinions, and mutual respect is expected at all times. 

        During Early Access, our primary objective is to establish a strong, reliable core team. We aim to recruit committed members, develop cohesion, and build a foundation that will carry us into launch and beyond. Our focus will be on mastering available zones, documenting loot tables and NPC mechanics, refining crafting systems, and optimizing group performance. Every step we take during this phase is designed to prepare us for high-end content, organized raiding, and long-term progression as a unified guild.

        We are not only focused on growing our guild, but also on establishing a strong, respectful presence within the broader game community. We believe in contributing positively, collaborating when appropriate, and maintaining a reputation built on integrity and skill.

        1. ROLLING COMMANDS:
        - Need Roll: Type /roll 100 if you need the item for your main role.
        - Greed Roll: Type /roll 100 if you want the item for other purposes after need rolls are complete.
        1. DETERMINING THE WINNER:
        - The highest Need Roll wins the item.
        - If no one rolls Need, the highest Greed Roll wins.

        PRIORITY RULES
        - PRIORITY RULES OVERVIEW:
        1. VETERAN PRIORITY: Players who have been actively participating in the group longer and contributing to the grind for the item have priority.
        - (Veteran players will roll first): (THIS IS FOR GUILD GROUPS ONLY, NOT RAIDS OR PUGS, AND SHOULD BE COMMUNICATED IF ANYTHING SPECIFIC IS BEING FARMED/CAMPED)
        - (Newcomers Roll Last): Newcomers or those who joined the raid recently can roll only after the veteran players have rolled and had their chance at the item. (THIS IS FOR GUILD GROUPS ONLY, NOT RAIDS OR PUGS, AND SHOULD BE COMMUNICATED IF ANYTHING SPECIFIC IS BEING FARMED/CAMPED)
        1. MAINS OVER ALTS: Main characters (mains) have priority over alternate characters (alts). Alts can roll Need only if no mains roll Need for the item.

        LOOT DISTRIBUTION AND RULES (Continued)
        - HANDLING OF LOOT DISPUTES:
        1. PRIVATE RESOLUTION: Any disputes regarding loot distribution must be handled privately. If you have an issue, discuss it directly with the raid leader or designated officers.
        2. NO PUBLIC COMPLAINTS: Publicly airing grievances or complaints about loot decisions is not allowed. Maintain respect for the process and the raid group by keeping discussions private.


        - SPECIAL LOOT CONDITIONS:
        1. ONE ITEM PER PLAYER: If a player wins an item, they may not roll Need again until all other players in the group have won an item during the session. This ensures fair distribution among all participants.
        2. ROLE/CLASS SPECIFIC ITEMS: Some items are more beneficial for specific roles (e.g., tanking gear for tanks). Such items should be rolled on Need only by players in that specific role unless no one in the role needs it.

        FINAL NOTES:
        1. FAIRNESS AND RESPECT: These rules are designed to maintain fairness and respect within the raid group. All members are expected to adhere to these rules to ensure a smooth and enjoyable raiding experience for everyone.
        2. COMMUNICATION IS KEY: Clear communication and adherence to these rules will help prevent misunderstandings and ensure everyone has a fair chance at loot.

        - Sponsorship Period: (NO PREDETERMINED TIME FRAME) The sponsor and recruit should regularly play together during a designated sponsorship period. During this time, the sponsor assesses the recruit's suitability for full membership.

        1. PROMOTION: (To full membership AKA" KNIGHT)
        - Sponsors: To bring your squire to the rank of Knight and gain them full membership into the guild you must speak to a KING (Asharak or Swatmedic) and be prepared to vouch for your squire's guild activity, attitude, willingness to help the guild and its members, and overall fitness to be a member of <Fallen>.
        - Timeframe: There is no set timeframe to promote a squire to full member, requests for promotion are at the discretion of the Sponsor, once a request is made the Sponsor will be heard and a decision will be made by the Kings.
