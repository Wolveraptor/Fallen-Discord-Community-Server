        LOOT DISTRIBUTION AND RULES:
        - LOOT SYSTEM OVERVIEW
        1. FAIR ROLLING: All loot is distributed through a rolling system to ensure fairness. The specifics of the rolling process are detailed below.
        2. ROLLING PROCESS:
        - Need Before Greed (NBG):
        - Need Roll: Roll if the item is a significant upgrade for your current main role (e.g., a DPS player rolling on a high-DPS weapon).
        - Greed Roll: Roll if you want the item for off-spec, selling, or Salvaging.
        - Greed rolls are made after all Need rolls have been resolved.
        3. ROLLING COMMANDS:
        - Need Roll: Type /roll 100 if you need the item for your main role.
        - Greed Roll: Type /roll 100 if you want the item for other purposes after need rolls are complete.
        4. DETERMINING THE WINNER:
        - The highest Need Roll wins the item.
        If no one rolls Need, the highest Greed Roll wins.


        PRIORITY RULES
        - PRIORITY RULES OVERVIEW:

        1. VETERAN PRIORITY: Players who have been actively participating in the group longer and contributing to the grind for the item have priority. 
        - (Veteran players will roll first): (THIS IS FOR GUILD GROUPS ONLY, NOT RAIDS OR PUGS, AND SHOULD BE COMMUNICATED IF ANYTHING SPECIFIC IS BEING FARMED/CAMPED)
        - (Newcomers Roll Last): Newcomers or those who joined the raid recently can roll only after the veteran players have rolled and had their chance at the item. (THIS IS FOR GUILD GROUPS ONLY, NOT RAIDS OR PUGS, AND SHOULD BE COMMUNICATED IF ANYTHING SPECIFIC IS BEING FARMED/CAMPED)
        2. MAINS OVER ALTS: Main characters (mains) have priority over alternate characters (alts). Alts can roll Need only if no mains roll Need for the item.

        LOOT DISTRIBUTION AND RULES (Continued)
        - HANDLING OF LOOT DISPUTES:
        1. PRIVATE RESOLUTION: Any disputes regarding loot distribution must be handled privately. If you have an issue, discuss it directly with the raid leader or designated officers.
        2. NO PUBLIC COMPLAINTS: Publicly airing grievances or complaints about loot decisions is not allowed. Maintain respect for the process and the raid group by keeping discussions private.


        - SPECIAL LOOT CONDITIONS
        1. ONE ITEM PER PLAYER: If a player wins an item, they may not roll Need again until all other players in the group have won an item during the session. This ensures fair distribution among all participants.
        2. ROLE/CLASS SPECIFIC ITEMS: Some items are more beneficial for specific roles (e.g., tanking gear for tanks). Such items should be rolled on Need only by players in that specific role unless no one in the role needs it.



        FINAL NOTES
        1. FAIRNESS AND RESPECT: These rules are designed to maintain fairness and respect within the raid group. All members are expected to adhere to these rules to ensure a smooth and enjoyable raiding experience for everyone.
        2. COMMUNICATION IS KEY: Clear communication and adherence to these rules will help prevent misunderstandings and ensure everyone has a fair chance at loot.
