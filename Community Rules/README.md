#### 04/22/25 - 8:55 PM EST
* The below was taken from the `Welcome Channel` rules.
* RULES:
    * GENERAL:
        * Conduct yourself in a respectful manner.
        * Feel free to share your thoughts and to disagree but be respectful and keep our house stress free.
        * Don't be divisive. Any differences we have as people must be left at the door. In this house we are all < Fallen> and that is all that matters.
* GUILD EVENT:
    * OVERVIEW: A guild event will be a planned and coordinated activity, organized by the guild. These events will be scheduled in advance and are aimed at achieving specific goals that benefit the guild as a whole.
    * CHARACTERISTICS:
        1. PLANNING AND COORDINATION: Leaders or officers within the guild will schedule the event, communicate the objectives, and assign roles to members. This can involve meetings, announcements, and detailed instructions.
        2. OBJECTIVES: The objectives can vary widely, including:
            * Raiding high-level dungeons or bosses.
            * Completing large-scale quests or achievements.
            * PvP (Player vs. Player) battles or tournaments.
            * Community-building activities like guild parties or in-game celebrations.
        3. PARTICIPATION: Participation is usually limited to guild members. This fosters a sense of community and teamwork.
    * LOOT HANDLING AND DISTRIBUTION:
        1. PREDETERMINED RULES: Loot will follow Looting rules established here.
        2. FAIRNESS AND TRANSPARENCY: Efforts are made to ensure loot is distributed fairly among guild members, rewarding those who contribute regularly or have specific needs for their roles.
        3. GUILD BANK: Some loot may be contributed to a guild bank, a communal repository of resources that can be used for future guild activities or distributed as needed.
* NORMAL GROUP/MULTI GROUP SESSIONS:
    * OVERVIEW: A normal group or multi-group session is a more spontaneous and less formalized gathering of players. These sessions can involve friends, acquaintances, or random players who come together to achieve a common goal.
    * CHARACTERISTICS:
        1. SPONTANEITY: These sessions are often organized on the fly. Players might group up quickly to tackle a dungeon, complete quests.
        2. OBJECTIVES: The goals are typically short-term and immediate, such as:
            * Completing quests.
            * Farming specific items or resources.
            * Defeating bosses.
        3. PARTICIPATION: These groups can include anyone, from friends and guild members to random players found through the game's matchmaking system.
    * LOOT HANDLING AND DISTRIBUTION:
        1. LOOT: Loot is handled by the group that is there.
        2. INFORMAL AGREEMENTS: Players might make informal agreements about loot distribution, like agreeing to pass on certain items or trade loot after the session.
        3. LESS REGULATIONS: Thereâ€™s typically less regulation and oversight compared to guild events, which can sometimes lead to disputes or uneven distribution.
* LOOT DISTRIBUTION AND RULES:
    * LOOT SYSTEM OVERVIEW:
        1. FAIR ROLLING: All loot is distributed through a rolling system to ensure fairness. The specifics of the rolling process are detailed below.
        2. ROLLING PROCESS:
            * Need Before Greed (NBG):
                * Need Roll: Roll if the item is a significant upgrade for your current main role (e.g., a DPS player rolling on a high-DPS weapon).
                * Greed Roll: Roll if you want the item for off-spec, selling, or Salvaging.
                * Greed rolls are made after all Need rolls have been resolved.
        3. ROLLING COMMANDS:
            * Need Roll: Type /roll 100 if you need the item for your main role.
            * Greed Roll: Type /roll 100 if you want the item for other purposes after need rolls are complete.
        4. DETERMINING THE WINNER:
            * The highest Need Roll wins the item.
            * If no one rolls Need, the highest Greed Roll wins.
* PRIORITY RULES
    * PRIORITY RULES OVERVIEW:
        1. VETERAN PRIORITY: Players who have been actively participating in the group longer and contributing to the grind for the item have priority.
            * (Veteran players will roll first): (THIS IS FOR GUILD GROUPS ONLY, NOT RAIDS OR PUGS, AND SHOULD BE COMMUNICATED IF ANYTHING SPECIFIC IS BEING FARMED/CAMPED)
            * (Newcomers Roll Last): Newcomers or those who joined the raid recently can roll only after the veteran players have rolled and had their chance at the item. (THIS IS FOR GUILD GROUPS ONLY, NOT RAIDS OR PUGS, AND SHOULD BE COMMUNICATED IF ANYTHING SPECIFIC IS BEING FARMED/CAMPED)
        2. MAINS OVER ALTS: Main characters (mains) have priority over alternate characters (alts). Alts can roll Need only if no mains roll Need for the item.
* LOOT DISTRIBUTION AND RULES (Continued)
    * HANDLING OF LOOT DISPUTES:
        1. PRIVATE RESOLUTION: Any disputes regarding loot distribution must be handled privately. If you have an issue, discuss it directly with the raid leader or designated officers.
        2. NO PUBLIC COMPLAINTS: Publicly airing grievances or complaints about loot decisions is not allowed. Maintain respect for the process and the raid group by keeping discussions private.
    * SPECIAL LOOT CONDITIONS:
        1. ONE ITEM PER PLAYER: If a player wins an item, they may not roll Need again until all other players in the group have won an item during the session. This ensures fair distribution among all participants.
        2. ROLE/CLASS SPECIFIC ITEMS: Some items are more beneficial for specific roles (e.g., tanking gear for tanks). Such items should be rolled on Need only by players in that specific role unless no one in the role needs it.
    * FINAL NOTES:
        1. FAIRNESS AND RESPECT: These rules are designed to maintain fairness and respect within the raid group. All members are expected to adhere to these rules to ensure a smooth and enjoyable raiding experience for everyone.
        2. COMMUNICATION IS KEY: Clear communication and adherence to these rules will help prevent misunderstandings and ensure everyone has a fair chance at loot.
* GUILD MEMBER PROMOTION PROCESS: (SQUIRE to KNIGHT)
    * RECRUITMENT AND SPONSORSHIP
        1. RECRUITMENT:
            * Identify Potential Recruits: Guild members can suggest new players who show promise and interest in joining the guild.
            * Invitation to Discord: Ensure any player who wishes to join `<Fallen>`, first receives an invite to discord, matches their discord name to their main character name in game, reads and accepts the #welcome-rules, finds a sponsor and updates their sponsorship in #guild-roster...(PRIOR TO RECIEVING A GUILD TAG IN GAME)
        2. SPONSORSHIP (1 SQUIRE PER MEMBER)
            * Initial Assessment: Conduct an informal assessment of the recruit's skills, behavior, and compatibility with the guild's values and objectives.
            * Assign a Sponsor: Each recruit should be paired with a seasoned guild member (Knight or above) who will act as their sponsor. The sponsor will guide the recruit, introduce them to guild activities, and monitor their progress.
            * Sponsorship Period: (NO PREDETERMINED TIME FRAME) The sponsor and recruit should regularly play together during a designated sponsorship period. During this time, the sponsor assesses the recruit's suitability for full membership.
            * Sponsors should witness their Squire attend at least 1 guild event:  and determine if they were able to maintain comms discipline during the event, determine if they were able to follow instructions, and witness their level of participation during the event.
        3. PROMOTION: (To full membership AKA" KNIGHT)
            * Sponsors: To bring your squire to the rank of Knight and gain them full membership into the guild you must speak to a KING (Asharak or Swatmedic) and be prepared to vouch for your squire's guild activity, attitude, willingness to help the guild and its members, and overall fitness to be a member of `<Fallen>`.
            * Timeframe: There is no set timeframe to promote a squire to full member, requests for promotion are at the discretion of the Sponsor, once a request is made the Sponsor will be heard and a decision will be made by the Kings.
